The primary reason for chosing a regression-based model was the fact that it, unlike classification, would be based on arithmatic.
This is ideal as stock prices are continious, numerical values. A regressive model can then estimate, with high accuracy, the price of the stock at a given point
based on previous trends in the values.
Classification models, on the other hand, are not designed with numerical values in mind, beyond categorizing (odd, even, prime, ends with a 7)
So, to conclude, we elected to use a regression model rather than a classification model, because it was meant to work with numerical values and their connection.
